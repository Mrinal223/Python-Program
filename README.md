Python Assignment Questions

1. Basic Syntax, Data Types, Variables, Operators, Input/Output
1. Write a Python program to take the name, age, and height of a person as input. Then,
calculate and display how many years are left for the person to turn 100.
Example: "You will turn 100 in 60 years."

2. Create a program that accepts a float input representing a person's weight in kilograms
and their height in meters. Calculate and display their Body Mass Index (BMI).
Formula: BMI = weight / (height * height)

2. Declaring Variables, Data Types in Programs
3. Write a Python program to swap two variables without using a third variable.
Example: If a = 5 and b = 10, the output should be a = 10 and b = 5.

4. Write a program that accepts a string input and counts the number of vowels and
consonants in the string.

3. Flow of Control (Modules, Branching)
5. Write a program that imports the random module to generate a random number between
1 and 50. Ask the user to guess the number, and provide feedback if the guess is too high, too
low, or correct.

6. Create a Python program that imports the datetime module to display the current date
and time in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.

4. If, If-else, Nested If-else
7. Write a Python program that takes a person's age as input and checks if they are eligible
to vote (age >= 18). If they are eligible, check if they are also eligible to run for public office
(age >= 25).

8. Write a Python program to check if a given number is divisible by 3 and 5 both. If not,
print whether it is divisible by only one of them or neither.

5. Looping (For, While, Nested Loops)
9. Write a Python program that prints the multiplication table of a number entered by the
user, up to 10.

10. Create a Python program that calculates the factorial of a number using a while loop.

11. Write a program to display all prime numbers between 1 and 100 using a for loop and a
nested loop to check for primality.

12. Write a Python program that calculates the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 50 using a
for loop.

6. Control Structures
13. Write a Python program that asks the user for a password and keeps asking until the
correct password is entered. After three failed attempts, the program should print "Access
Denied."

14. Create a Python program that asks for a number from the user and checks if the number
is a perfect number (a number that is equal to the sum of its divisors excluding itself).
Example of a perfect number: 6 (1 + 2 + 3 = 6)

7. Break, Continue, and Pass
15. Write a Python program that prints numbers from 1 to 10 but skips the numbers that
are divisible by 4 using the continue statement.

16. Create a Python program that asks the user to enter numbers until they enter a negative
number. The program should then stop using the break statement.

17. Write a Python program to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to 100 but stop if the
sum exceeds 1000, using the break statement.

18. Write a Python program using a for loop where the pass statement is used when the loop
encounters the number 5. The program should print numbers from 1 to 10 but not take any
action when it reaches 5.

8. Combining Topics
19. Write a Python program that takes 5 subject marks from the user and calculates the
percentage. Based on the percentage, determine the grade using if-else conditions:
A: >= 90
B: >= 75
C: >= 50
F: < 50

20. Write a Python program to simulate a simple calculator. The program should ask for two
numbers and an operation (+, -, *, /). Based on the user's input, the program should perform
the appropriate operation. Use if-else to handle different operations.
